          Bo Hwang writes story-like poems and poem-like stories. They like each other anyway. She was a 2022 Periplus Fellow and is currently the Anselm Hollo Fellow at Naropa University where she is working on a collection of short stories. You can find a sliver of her work below.

                After a winter of droughts, my childhood friend—my only
